My name: Derek Ross
My Email: Derek_Ross@student.uml.edu
My GitHub: https://github.com/DerekR0123
Where to Find Code: This repository located in the above github.

What I did:

I started off by opening the document recommended and scrolling through till I seen Web Applications In Racket. A light bulb popped
in my head instantly because I love to create and design websites! I followed this neat little tutorial that was listed and understood some of the code provided through the use of the library. Below is an example of the code:

****************** START OF CODE SAMPLE *****************************

#lang web-server/insta
;;Library used to create the websites

(define (start request)
  ;;Sends a request to your web browser
  
  (response/xexpr
   ;;The request is picked up and opens something in the following format
   
   '(html
   
   ## Anything you wish to add to the page goes here! You will see more cool stuff in my full example of the code! ##
   )))
   
   
   ****************** END OF CODE SAMPLE **********************************
   
   
   That is just a small snippit of the code with some comments. You can find the full source in this repository. Here is what
   the output result of the code looks like:
