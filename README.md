What I did: <br>
<br>
I started off by opening the document recommended and scrolling through till I seen Web Applications In Racket. A light bulb popped 
in my head instantly because I love to create and design websites! I followed this neat little tutorial that was listed and understood some of the code provided through the use of the library. Below is an example of the code:<br>
<br>
****************** START OF CODE SAMPLE *****************************<br>
<br>
 <p> #lang web-server/insta </p> <br>
;;Library used to create the websites<br>
<br>
(define (start request)<br>
  ;;Sends a request to your web browser<br>
  <br>
  (response/xexpr<br>
   ;;The request is picked up and opens something in the following format<br>
   <br>
   '(html<br>
   <br>

   That is just a small snippit of the code with some comments. You can find the full source in this repository. Here is what<br>
   the output result of the code looks like:<br>
